## Hi there! 👋

I’m a recent graduate from King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) and a passionate **Full Stack Developer**. I love building both web and mobile applications that people enjoy using.

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and exploring creative solutions to real-world problems.
